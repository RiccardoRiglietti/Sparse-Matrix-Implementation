# Definition of a sparse matrix
In numerical analysis and scientific computing, a sparse matrix or sparse array is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. There is no strict definition regarding the proportion of zero-value elements for a matrix to qualify as sparse but a common criterion is that the number of non-zero elements is roughly equal to the number of rows or columns. By contrast, if most of the elements are non-zero, the matrix is considered dense. The number of zero-valued elements divided by the total number of elements (e.g., m × n for an m × n matrix) is sometimes referred to as the sparsity of the matrix. (From Wikipedia)

# Applications of sparse matrices
Sparse matrices appear in the mathematical formulation of many problems, and when they do, having the correct way to represent them can be very useful to improve the efficiency of the computations:
